Hi,
I am one of the OTA student and an Android Application Developer.
I have developed this App to scan Bigtradelist stocks to check Candle Status (Boring, Green, Red) In the given Date Range.

* How to use this App?
-If you want to scan the stock for specific day, select Start Date and End Date a same date and click on process.

-If you want to scan the stock for specific week,select Start Date as Monday End Date as a Friday of the Week and click on process.

-If you want to scan the stock for specific Month,select Start Date as First Day of Month and  End Date as a last day of the Month and click on process.


* Technical Limitation With this App?
- I was unable to find any free API which provides Data for current day at the End of the Day with Open and Close Values.
So you cant check Today's Candle, You can select only till Yesterday.

- If You need Daily chart Status of Todays Closing, you have to scan this in next Day Morning and cannot be scanned Today Itself,
I am trying to find a way to acheive this if any one of you come across any solution please feel free to contact me.
Make sure you write [OTA] in Subject.

* Special Request
 - Don't Select a Holiday Date as Start Date or End Date ,This will crash the Application and you have to start again.
 - Check Holiday List in menu
